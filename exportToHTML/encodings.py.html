<span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;Imposter encodings module that installs a coverage-style tracer. 
 
This is NOT the encodings module; it is an imposter that sets up tracing 
instrumentation and then replaces itself with the real encodings module. 
 
If the directory that holds this file is placed first in the PYTHONPATH when 
using &quot;coverage&quot; to run Python's tests, then this file will become the very 
first module imported by the internals of Python 3.  It installs a 
coverage.py-compatible trace function that can watch Standard Library modules 
execute from the very earliest stages of Python's own boot process.  This fixes 
a problem with coverage.py - that it starts too late to trace the coverage of 
many of the most fundamental modules in the Standard Library.

        <span class="s0"># frame object is used for a whole scope, with new line numbers</span>

        <span class="s0"># same object, and will eventually all will point to the last line</span>
        <span class="s0"># executed.  So we keep the line numbers alongside the frames.</span>
