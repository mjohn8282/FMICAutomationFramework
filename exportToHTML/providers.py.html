        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Given a requirement or candidate, return an identifier for it. 
 
        This is used in many places to identify a requirement or candidate, 
        e.g. whether two requirements should have their specifier parts merged, 
        whether two candidates would conflict with each other (because they 
        have same name but different versions).

    <span class="s0">def </span><span class="s1">get_preference(self, resolution, candidates, information):</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Produce a sort key for given requirement based on preference. 
 
        The preference is defined as &quot;I think this requirement should be 
        resolved first&quot;. The lower the return value is, the more preferred 
        this group of arguments is. 
 
        :param resolution: Currently pinned candidate, or `None`. 
        :param candidates: An iterable of possible candidates. 
        :param information: A list of requirement information. 
 
        The `candidates` iterable's exact type depends on the return type of 
        `find_matches()`. A sequence is passed-in as-is if possible. If it 
        returns a callble, the iterator returned by that callable is passed 
        in here. 
 
        Each element in `information` is a named tuple with two entries: 
 
        * `requirement` specifies a requirement contributing to the current 
          candidate list. 
        * `parent` specifies the candidate that provides (dependend on) the 
          requirement, or `None` to indicate a root requirement. 
 
        The preference could depend on a various of issues, including (not 
        necessarily in this order): 
 
        * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result? 
        * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be 
          worked on first? (I don't know, actually.) 
        * How many possibilities are there to satisfy this requirement? Those 
          with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess? 
        * Are there any known conflicts for this requirement? We should 
          probably work on those with the most known conflicts. 
 
        A sortable value should be returned (this will be used as the `key` 
        parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is, 
        the more preferred this requirement is (i.e. the sorting function 
        is called with `reverse=False`).

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Find all possible candidates that satisfy the given requirements. 
 
        This should try to get candidates based on the requirements' types. 
        For VCS, local, and archive requirements, the one-and-only match is 
        returned, and for a &quot;named&quot; requirement, the index(es) should be 
        consulted to find concrete candidates for this requirement. 
 
        The return value should produce candidates ordered by preference; the 
        most preferred candidate should come first. The return type may be one 
        of the following: 
 
        * A callable that returns an iterator that yields candidates. 
        * An collection of candidates. 
        * An iterable of candidates. This will be consumed immediately into a 
          list of candidates. 
 
        :param requirements: A collection of requirements which all of the 
            returned candidates must match. All requirements are guaranteed to 
            have the same identifier. The collection is never empty.

        The candidate is guarenteed to have been generated from the 
        requirement. 
 
        A boolean should be returned to indicate whether `candidate` is a 
        viable solution to the requirement.
