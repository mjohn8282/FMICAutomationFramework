<span class="s2"># Notes on the relationship between the provider, the factory, and the</span>
<span class="s2"># candidate and requirement classes.</span>
<span class="s2">#</span>
<span class="s2"># The provider is a direct implementation of the resolvelib class. Its role</span>
<span class="s2"># is to deliver the API that resolvelib expects.</span>
<span class="s2">#</span>
<span class="s2"># Rather than work with completely abstract &quot;requirement&quot; and &quot;candidate&quot;</span>
<span class="s2"># concepts as resolvelib does, pip has concrete classes implementing these two</span>
<span class="s2"># ideas. The API of Requirement and Candidate objects are defined in the base</span>
<span class="s2"># classes, but essentially map fairly directly to the equivalent provider</span>
<span class="s2"># methods. In particular, `find_matches` and `is_satisfied_by` are</span>
<span class="s2"># requirement methods, and `get_dependencies` is a candidate method.</span>
<span class="s2">#</span>
<span class="s2"># The factory is the interface to pip's internal mechanisms. It is stateless,</span>
<span class="s2"># and is created by the resolver and held as a property of the provider. It is</span>
<span class="s2"># responsible for creating Requirement and Candidate objects, and provides</span>
<span class="s2"># services to those objects (access to pip's finder and preparer).</span>

        * Prefer if any of the known requirements points to an explicit URL. 
        * If equal, prefer if any requirements contain ``===`` and ``==``. 
        * If equal, prefer if requirements include version constraints, e.g. 
          ``&gt;=`` and ``&lt;``. 
        * If equal, prefer user-specified (non-transitive) requirements. 
        * If equal, order alphabetically for consistency (helps debuggability).
