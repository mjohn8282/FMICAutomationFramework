<span class="s0">class </span><span class="s1">LoadScheduling:</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Implement load scheduling across nodes. 
 
    This distributes the tests collected across all nodes so each test 
    is run just once.  All nodes collect and submit the test suite and 
    when all collections are received it is verified they are 
    identical collections.  Then the collection gets divided up in 
    chunks and chunks get submitted to nodes.  Whenever a node finishes 
    an item, it calls ``.mark_test_complete()`` which will trigger the 
    scheduler to assign more tests if the number of pending tests for 
    the node falls below a low-watermark. 
 
    When created, ``numnodes`` defines how many nodes are expected to 
    submit a collection. This is used to know when all nodes have 
    finished collection or how large the chunks need to be created. 
 
    Attributes: 
 
    :numnodes: The expected number of nodes taking part.  The actual 
       number of nodes will vary during the scheduler's lifetime as 
       nodes are added by the DSession as they are brought up and 
       removed either because of a dead node or normal shutdown.  This 
       number is primarily used to know when the initial collection is 
       completed. 
 
    :node2collection: Map of nodes and their test collection.  All 
       collections should always be identical. 
 
    :node2pending: Map of nodes and the indices of their pending 
       tests.  The indices are an index into ``.pending`` (which is 
       identical to their own collection stored in 
       ``.node2collection``). 
 
    :collection: The one collection once it is validated to be 
       identical between all the nodes.  It is initialised to None 
       until ``.schedule()`` is called. 
 
    :pending: List of indices of globally pending tests.  These are 
       tests which have not yet been allocated to a chunk for a node 
       to process. 
 
    :log: A py.log.Producer instance. 
 
    :config: Config object, used for handling hooks.
